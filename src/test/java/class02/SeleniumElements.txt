In Selenium, besides the WebElement, there are several other important elements and
components that play key roles in web automation.
These elements are part of the Selenium framework and are used to interact with different aspects of web applications.
The main types of elements in Selenium, apart from WebElement, are:

--------------------
WebDriver:
--------------------
The WebDriver is the core component of Selenium.
It is responsible for controlling the browser and performing actions on web elements.
The WebDriver acts as a bridge between your test scripts and the browser,
allowing you to open pages, navigate through them, interact with elements, and perform various operations.

--------------------
WebDriver Options:
--------------------
WebDriver Options provide a way to configure the browser's behavior and settings.
It allows you to set preferences, manage timeouts, handle cookies, and customize the browser's capabilities.
With WebDriver Options, you can modify the browser's behavior to suit your testing requirements.

--------------------
WebElement Locator Strategies:
--------------------
These are methods provided by Selenium to locate web elements on a web page. They include:

By.id(): Locates an element by its id attribute.
By.name(): Locates an element by its name attribute.
By.className(): Locates an element by its class attribute.
By.tagName(): Locates an element by its HTML tag name.
By.linkText(): Locates a link element by its exact text.
By.partialLinkText(): Locates a link element by partial text matching.
By.xpath(): Locates an element using XPath expressions.
By.cssSelector(): Locates an element using CSS selectors.

These locator strategies are used to identify and interact with specific elements on a web page.

--------------------
Alert:
--------------------
Alerts are pop-up dialog boxes that appear on a web page to display messages or prompt the user for input.
Selenium provides methods to handle and interact with alerts, such as accepting or
dismissing them and retrieving their text content.

--------------------
Select:
--------------------
The Select class is used to handle dropdown menus and select options from them.
It provides methods to interact with dropdowns, such as selecting options by visible text, value,
or index, checking if an option is selected, or retrieving all available options.

--------------------
Actions:
--------------------

The Actions class in Selenium allows you to perform complex user interactions,
such as mouse movements, keyboard events, context clicks, double-clicks, and drag-and-drop operations.
It provides methods to build and perform these actions on web elements.
