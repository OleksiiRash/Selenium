Xpath:

1. absolute xpath   --> starts with / and the root node (it is not widely used becuase the tree might change)
2.Relative Xpath

Attribute
//tagname[@attribute='value']

Contains  methods in attribute
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]

startsWith  method in attribute
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]

Text
//tagname[text()="value"]

Contains  methods in attribute
//tagname[contains(text(), 'partial attribute value')]

startsWith  method in text
//tagname[starts-with(text(), 'partial starting attribute value')]

Notes:
if you're unable to write down the unqiue xpath (no matter u tried to use various avialable xpath)
then u can use

Indexing to select your desired one
(//tagname[@attribute='value'])[index Number] ---> Index number starts with 1

use the contains or starts with only when
 1. the text or attribute is  containing a dynamic  part  and u are left with no other option
2. the text or attribute is long enough (and you are sure that it will always remian unique)

-------------
CSS Selector
-------------
Syntax:

tagname[attribute = 'attribute value']

limitation: u cant use text with CSS selector
Shortcuts are there in CSS selector that can be used to locate an element

Shortcut for className --> "."
tagName[class='attribute value'] ----->tagName.attribute Value

Shortcut for ID -- "#"
tagName[id='attribute value'] ----->tagName#attribute Value

we have a contains method in CSS as well

*  represents contains
tagname[attribute *= 'partial attribute value']

we have a starts with method in Css as well
^ sign represents the starts with
tagname[attribute ^= 'starting attribute value']

we have a ends with methods also in CSS
$ symbol represents ends-with method in css
tagname[attribute $= 'ending attribute value']

FOCUS SHOULD BE ON:
writing the locator that gets us the unqiue value
also we should make sure at our end that the future changes
will most probably not effect our xpath (try your best in this)
